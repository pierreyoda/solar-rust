# solar-rust [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pierreyoda/rust-lsystem.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pierreyoda/solar-rust)

A resource gathering game prototype written in Rust with piston and conrod set in a
randomly generated solar system.

The gameplay is to be focused around extensive building and upgrading of facilities and
resource convoys : think a mix between cookie clicker and Stellaris' resource gameplay.
